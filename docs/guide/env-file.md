## Editing your .env file

To be able to use this Discord Bot you need to edit the [`.env`](https://github.com/d-hoffi/Discord-LightningTipBot/blob/main/.env) file and fill in the right data.
This guide helps you with the process.

### BOT_TOKEN
The `BOT_TOKEN` variable needs to be generated by Discord.

  * First of all you have to create a new application using this [link](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Click `New Application` and choose a name for it
  * Replace `YourBotToken` with your real `BOT_TOKEN`

### API Endpoints

To use api endpoints it is necessary to run your own [lnbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend) instance ontop of your LN node. 
Point a domain to your lnbits before proceeding. Here is a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvExdnN1PQ) on how to do so.
You could use your own "non lnbits" backend, but editing source code might be necessary than.

The `PAYMENTS_API`, `LNURL_API`, `CREATE_USER_API` and `GET_WALLET_DETAILS_API` variables are all urls. You just need to change `https://yourdomain.com` to your actual domain.

### (Wallet) Keys
#### ADMIN_KEY
The `ADMIN_KEY` variable is the admin key of your admin lnbits wallet. Just copy and paste it from your LNbits instance.

#### ADMIN_INVOICE_KEY
The `ADMIN_INVOICE_KEY` variable is the invoice key of your admin lnbits wallet. Just copy and paste it from your LNbits instance.

#### ADMIN_WALLET_USER
The `ADMIN_WALLET_USER` is your user id, used to login to your lnbits wallet.
